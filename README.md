##### The SITL (software in the loop) simulator allows you to run Plane, Copter or Rover without any hardware. It is a build of the autopilot code using an ordinary C++ compiler, giving you a native executable that allows you to test the behaviour of the code without hardware.It takes advantage of the fact that ArduPilot is a portable autopilot that can run on a very wide variety of platforms.

*This article provides an overview of SITLâ€™s benefits and architecture.*
